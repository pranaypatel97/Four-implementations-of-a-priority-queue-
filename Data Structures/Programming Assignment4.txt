The stack processes jobs the fastest and is significantly faster than the others. This is due in part of the way its data structure is built; it is simple and does not require any sort of complex search, and is probably the fastest one of them. It seems that the four stack is the slower one, due in part of the multiple structures it has. The Linked List and Max Heap are however slower. Regular stack is probably the most efficient data structure according to the results of the experiment.
